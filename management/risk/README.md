# Risk

Risk in cybersecurity refers to the potential for loss, damage, or disruption due to a threat exploiting a vulnerability. Managing risk means identifying, assessing, and minimizing that potential impact.

## Key Definitions

- **Risk**: The potential for negative outcomes (e.g., data breach, downtime)
- **Threat**: A potential cause of an unwanted incident
- **Vulnerability**: A weakness that can be exploited
- **Control**: A safeguard to reduce risk

---

## Risk Equation

> **Risk = Threat × Vulnerability × Impact**

- If any component is zero, the risk is minimized
- Strong controls aim to reduce vulnerability and impact

---

## Risk Assessment

**Purpose:** Identify what could go wrong, the likelihood it will happen, and what the consequences would be.

**Steps:**
1. Identify potential hazards (assets + threats)
2. Determine who or what might be harmed
3. Evaluate severity and likelihood
4. Implement and document controls
5. Reassess periodically

## Risk Treatment Options

- **Mitigation**: Reduce risk by applying controls (e.g., firewalls, patches)
- **Transfer**: Shift responsibility (e.g., insurance, outsourcing)
- **Acceptance**: Acknowledge and tolerate the risk (low impact/likelihood)
- **Avoidance**: Eliminate the activity causing the risk

## Real-World Example

**Scenario:** Employee loses a company laptop  
- **Threat**: Theft  
- **Vulnerability**: Lack of encryption or tracking  
- **Impact**: Data leak, financial loss  
- **Mitigation**: Full-disk encryption, remote wipe, user training

## Why Risk Management Matters

- Supports compliance and audits (e.g., ISO 27001, NIST RMF)
- Prioritizes security investments based on risk levels
- Strengthens organizational resilience

> You can’t eliminate all risk—but you can understand it, measure it, and control it. That’s what turns a reactive IT team into a proactive security operation.
