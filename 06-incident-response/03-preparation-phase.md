# 6.3: Preparation Phase

Preparation is the foundation of effective incident response. This phase involves creating comprehensive plans, building skilled teams, and establishing the infrastructure needed to respond effectively when incidents occur.

## Incident Response Plans (IRP)

**A well-documented IRP** prevents confusion during high-stress incidents and ensures consistent, effective responses.

| Impact Level | Business Effect | Examples |
|-------------|----------------|----------|
| **Severe** | Operations halted | Payment systems down, manufacturing stopped |
| **Major** | Significant disruption | Email systems compromised, databases locked |
| **Moderate** | Limited impact | Individual workstations affected |
| **Minor** | Minimal disruption | Non-critical systems impacted |

### 3. Containment Section

#### Evidence Preservation Guidelines
- **Memory analysis priority** - volatile data collection before shutdown
- **Write-blocker usage** for disk imaging and analysis
- **Chain of custody** documentation requirements
- **Photography** of physical evidence and system states

#### Containment Strategy Selection

| Containment Type | Use Case | Considerations |
|-----------------|----------|----------------|
| **Network Isolation** | Malware spread prevention | May lose remote access |
| **Account Disabling** | Credential compromise | User productivity impact |
| **Service Shutdown** | Critical system protection | Business continuity needs |
| **Backup Activation** | System replacement | Recovery time objectives |

### 4. Eradication & Recovery Sections

#### Analysis Requirements
- **MITRE ATT&CK mapping** for technique identification
- **Root cause analysis** using forensic examination
- **IOC generation** for threat hunting and sharing
- **Timeline reconstruction** for complete understanding

#### Defensive Hardening
- **Patch management** for exploited vulnerabilities
- **Configuration changes** to prevent reoccurrence  
- **NIPS/HIPS rule updates** using discovered IOCs
- **Run-book creation** for similar future incidents

## Asset Inventory and Risk Assessment

### Asset Inventory Management

#### Comprehensive Asset Database (CMDB)
**Asset Categories**:
- **Endpoints**: Desktops, laptops, mobile devices
- **Servers**: Physical and virtual infrastructure  
- **Network devices**: Firewalls, switches, routers, load balancers
- **IoT devices**: Connected sensors, appliances, and systems

- **Operating system** version and patch level
- **Installed software** inventory and versions
- **Network configuration** including IP addresses and VLANs
- **Data classification** and sensitivity levels
- **Business criticality** rating and dependencies

### Risk Assessment Framework

#### Risk Calculation Matrix
```
Risk = Threat × Vulnerability × Impact
```

#### Asset Prioritization Criteria

| Priority Level | Characteristics | Response Requirements |
|---------------|----------------|----------------------|
| **Critical** | Mission-essential, customer-facing | 24/7 monitoring, immediate response |
| **High** | Important business functions | Business hours monitoring, <4hr response |
| **Medium** | Supporting systems | Standard monitoring, <24hr response |
| **Low** | Non-essential systems | Basic monitoring, best-effort response |

#### Risk Treatment Strategies

| Strategy | Application | Examples |
|----------|------------|----------|
| **Mitigate** | Cost-effective controls available | Patch management, access controls |
| **Transfer** | Insurance or outsourcing viable | Cyber insurance, cloud services |
| **Accept** | Low impact, high cost to mitigate | Legacy systems near retirement |
| **Avoid** | Unacceptable risk levels | Discontinue risky services |

### Business Impact Analysis Integration

#### Critical System Dependencies
- **Business Continuity Plan** integration for priority identification
- **Recovery Time Objectives (RTO)** for each system classification
- **Recovery Point Objectives (RPO)** for data loss tolerance
- **Maximum Tolerable Downtime (MTD)** calculations

#### Incident Prioritization Matrix
When multiple incidents occur simultaneously:

1. **Customer-facing systems** take priority over internal tools
2. **Revenue-generating** systems prioritized over support systems  
3. **Regulated data** systems require immediate attention
4. **Safety-critical** systems override all other priorities
