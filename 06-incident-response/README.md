# Module 6: Incident Response

This module covers the complete incident response lifecycle, from preparation and prevention through detection, analysis, containment, and lessons learned. Based on NIST SP 800-61r2 guidelines, it provides practical frameworks for responding to cyber attacks and security incidents.
