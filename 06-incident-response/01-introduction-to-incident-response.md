# 6.1: Introduction to Incident Response

Understanding the fundamentals of incident response is crucial for any blue team professional. This section covers the core concepts, terminology, and organizational structures that form the foundation of effective IR programs.

## What is Incident Response?

**Incident Response (IR)** is the structured methodology an organization uses to respond to and manage cyber attacks. It's a reactive approach closely aligned with disaster recovery efforts, designed to minimize damage and restore normal operations as quickly as possible.

### Core Objectives
- **Limit damage** caused by successful attacks
- **Reduce recovery time** and associated costs
- **Maintain business continuity** during security incidents
- **Learn from incidents** to improve future defenses

## Security Events vs Security Incidents

Understanding this distinction is critical for proper escalation and resource allocation.

### Security Events üîç
**Definition**: Anything that *could* have security implications but hasn't caused confirmed damage.

| Event Type | Example | Why It's an Event |
|------------|---------|------------------|
| **Spam Email** | Suspicious email with potential malicious link | *Could* lead to credential harvesting |
| **Vulnerability Scan** | External scanning of public IP ranges | *Could* identify exploitable weaknesses |
| **Reconnaissance** | Port scanning or network enumeration | *Could* gather intel for future attacks |
| **Failed Brute Force** | Multiple login failures without success | *Could* indicate attack attempts |
| **Software Download** | User downloads file from internet | *Could* contain malware or trojans |

> **Key Point**: Events are typically handled by **SOC analysts** through automated controls or logging for potential escalation.

### Security Incidents ‚ö†Ô∏è
**Definition**: Security events that have resulted in **confirmed damage** to the organization.

| Incident Type | Event That Escalated | Damage Caused |
|---------------|---------------------|---------------|
| **Ransomware** | Spam email with malicious attachment | Files encrypted, operations disrupted |
| **Data Breach** | Successful exploitation of scanned vulnerability | Sensitive data exfiltrated |
| **System Compromise** | Successful brute force attack | Unauthorized access to internal systems |
| **Malware Infection** | Downloaded malware executed | C2 communication, data collection |

> **Key Point**: Incidents require **specialist incident responders** and potentially external CSIRT activation.

## Why Incident Response is Critical

### Financial Impact of Poor IR

**GDPR Fines Demonstrate Real Costs**:

| Organization | Fine Amount | Violation |
|-------------|-------------|-----------|
| Google | ‚Ç¨50 million | Consent violations |
| H&M | ‚Ç¨35.3 million | Employee data misuse |
| TIM (Telecom Italia) | ‚Ç¨27.8 million | Data breach response failures |
| British Airways | ¬£20 million | Customer data compromise |
| Marriott International | ¬£18.4 million | Inadequate security measures |

### Beyond Financial Penalties
- **Customer trust erosion** leading to business loss
- **Stock price impacts** from public breach disclosure
- **Recovery costs** for damaged/infected systems
- **External consultant fees** for emergency response
- **Legal costs** from regulatory investigations

> **ROI Perspective**: If the cost of running an IR team is less than potential regulatory fines, the business saves money!

## CSIRT and CERT Explained

### Computer Security Incident Response Team (CSIRT)
**Internal organizational teams** responsible for coordinating incident response.

#### Core Responsibilities
- **Central command center** for incident coordination
- **Security awareness and training** programs (including phishing exercises)
- **Emergency contact point** for cybersecurity issues
- **Vulnerability research** and mitigation planning
- **MTTR/MDT calculation** for organizational assets
- **Intelligence sharing** with security community

#### CSIRT Composition
CSIRTs aren't just security professionals - they're **cross-functional teams**:
- Infrastructure and networking specialists
- Legal and compliance representatives
- Public relations and communications
- Human resources personnel
- Executive leadership (C-suite involvement)

### Computer Emergency Response Team (CERT)
**Government-sponsored teams** focused on national cybersecurity.

#### Public vs Private Distinction

| Aspect | CERT | CSIRT |
|--------|------|-------|
| **Scope** | National/public sector | Private organizations |
| **Examples** | US-CERT, CERT-UK, AusCERT | Internal business teams |
| **Mission** | Protect citizens and critical infrastructure | Protect organizational assets |
| **Authority** | Government-backed | Corporate authority only |

#### Alternative Naming
Organizations may use various terms for similar functions:
- **SIRT** (Security Incident Response Team)
- **IRT** (Incident Response Team)  
- **CSIRC** (Computer Security Incident Response Centre)

## Case Study: New Zealand CERT

**CERT NZ** exemplifies effective national-level incident response:

### Public Transparency
- **Quarterly reports** on incident trends and responses
- **Annual summaries** of threat landscape evolution
- **Public awareness campaigns** for citizens and businesses
- **Cross-sector intelligence sharing** with private organizations

### Collaborative Approach
- **International coordination** with other national CERTs
- **Private sector partnerships** for threat intelligence
- **Academic collaboration** for research and education
- **Standardized reporting mechanisms** for incident data

## Key Terminology Reference

| Term | Definition |
|------|------------|
| **IRP** | Incident Response Plan - Documented procedures for handling incidents |
| **IOC** | Indicator of Compromise - Evidence of malicious activity or intrusion |
| **TTP** | Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures - Adversary behavior patterns |
| **DMZ** | Demilitarized Zone - Network segment exposing services to untrusted networks |
| **EDR** | Endpoint Detection and Response - Advanced endpoint monitoring platform |
| **SIEM** | Security Information and Event Management - Centralized log analysis platform |

## Summary

Incident response is not just a technical discipline - it's a **business-critical capability** that requires:

‚úÖ **Clear understanding** of events vs incidents  
‚úÖ **Cross-functional team collaboration** beyond just security  
‚úÖ **Proactive preparation** rather than reactive scrambling  
‚úÖ **Executive support** and adequate resourcing  
‚úÖ **Continuous improvement** through lessons learned  

The foundation of effective IR lies in proper preparation, which we'll explore in the next section.
