# Policies and Procedures

Policies and procedures form the backbone of a secure organization. They define what is allowed, expected, and enforced, guiding employee behavior and operational consistency.

---

## What Is a Policy?

- A high-level statement of intent or direction
- Defines expectations and responsibilities
- May be driven by internal goals or external compliance requirements
- Forms the foundation for standards, procedures, and guidelines

**Hierarchy:**
1. Policies – what to do
2. Standards – consistent rules to support the policy
3. Procedures – how to do it
4. Guidelines – recommended practices

---

## Why Policies Matter

- Enforce consistency and accountability
- Reduce human error and insider threats
- Support legal and regulatory compliance
- Define disciplinary action for violations

---

## Common Security Policies

### Acceptable Use Policy (AUP)
- Defines acceptable behaviors on company devices or networks
- Includes restrictions on personal use, prohibited sites, and software
- Outlines consequences for violations (e.g., loss of access, disciplinary action)

### Service Level Agreement (SLA)
- Defines service expectations between provider and client
- Includes uptime, performance, support response times, and penalties

### Bring Your Own Device (BYOD) Policy
- Governs use of personal devices on the corporate network
- May require MDM enrollment, antivirus, or limited access zones

### Memorandum of Understanding (MOU)
- Outlines mutual expectations between two parties
- Not legally binding but documents intent and responsibilities

### Standard Operating Procedures (SOPs)
- Step-by-step instructions for performing routine tasks
- Ensures consistency across users and teams

## Best Practices

- Review and update policies annually or after major changes
- Align with compliance standards (e.g., NIST, ISO 27001)
- Provide training and awareness for all users
- Ensure management buy-in and legal review

> Policies turn good intentions into enforceable action. Without them, security becomes optional—and that's a risk no organization can afford.
