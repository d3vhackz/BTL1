## 🌐 Common Ports and Security Implications

| Port | Protocol | Service | Security Notes |
|------|----------|---------|----------------|
| **21** | FTP | File Transfer | ⚠️ Insecure - use SFTP (22) instead |
| **22** | SSH | Secure Shell | ✅ Encrypted remote access |
| **25** | SMTP | Email Transfer | ⚠️ Often targeted for spam relay |
| **53** | DNS | Name Resolution | 🔍 Monitor for DNS tunneling |
| **80** | HTTP | Web Traffic | ⚠️ Unencrypted - prefer HTTPS (443) |
| **443** | HTTPS | Secure Web | ✅ Encrypted web communications |

## 📋 Risk Management Matrix

| Risk Level | Likelihood | Impact | Treatment Strategy | Examples |
|------------|------------|--------|-------------------|----------|
| **Critical** | High | High | Immediate mitigation | Zero-day exploits, data breaches |
| **High** | High | Medium OR Medium | High | Priority patching, enhanced monitoring |
| **Medium** | Medium | Medium | Planned mitigation | Routine vulnerabilities, policy gaps |
| **Low** | Low | Low | Accept or monitor | Minor configuration issues |

### Risk Treatment Options
- **🛡️ Mitigation**: Implement controls to reduce risk
- **📋 Transfer**: Shift risk to third parties (insurance, outsourcing)
- **✅ Acceptance**: Acknowledge and tolerate acceptable risk
- **🚫 Avoidance**: Eliminate the risk-causing activity
