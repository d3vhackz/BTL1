# Physical Security

Physical security refers to measures designed to protect physical assets, personnel, and infrastructure from unauthorized access, damage, or disruption.

## Key Control Types

- **Deterrent Controls**  
  Discourage potential threats through visibility or consequence.  
  _Example_: Security guards, warning signs

- **Preventive Controls**  
  Block or restrict physical access.  
  _Example_: Locked doors, fences, biometric scanners

- **Detective Controls**  
  Identify and log unauthorized access attempts.  
  _Example_: CCTV, motion detectors, intrusion alarms

- **Corrective/Recovery Controls**  
  Respond to and restore normal operations after an incident.  
  _Example_: Emergency exits, backup power systems, disaster recovery plans

## Common Physical Security Measures

- **Access Control Systems**
  - Badges, key cards, biometric readers
  - Access logs can be reviewed for suspicious behavior

- **Security Guards & Receptionists**
  - Human presence deters intruders
  - Can verify identity or intervene when needed

- **Barriers & Fencing**
  - Define secure perimeters and delay entry

- **Surveillance Cameras (CCTV)**
  - Record movement and behavior in sensitive areas
  - Often integrated with motion sensors and alarms

- **Locks (Mechanical and Electronic)**
  - Critical for server rooms, IT closets, and data centers

## Best Practices

- Use layered security: combine physical, technical, and administrative controls
- Audit physical access regularly
- Monitor critical infrastructure areas 24/7
- Train employees on physical access policies

> Physical security is often overlooked but is one of the most essential components of a strong defense-in-depth strategy. Without it, even the best digital defenses can be bypassed through physical access.
