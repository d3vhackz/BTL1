# Threat Intelligence

## Introduction to Threat Intelligence

Threat intelligence is information that helps organizations understand current or potential threats. This knowledge supports proactive defense, informs risk mitigation strategies, and enables swift response to signs of compromise. Intelligence is typically shared in the form of Indicators of Compromise (IOCs) like malicious email addresses, IPs, or file hashes.

### Threat Intelligence Lifecycle

1. **Planning & Direction** – Set goals and scope.
2. **Collection** – Gather data from forums, OSINT, threat feeds, etc.
3. **Processing** – Translate and structure raw data for analysis.
4. **Analysis** – Turn data into actionable insights tailored to technical or non-technical audiences.
5. **Dissemination** – Share intelligence with SOC teams, TI analysts, or leadership.
6. **Feedback** – Refine efforts based on ongoing team input and evolving threats.

### Threat Intelligence Analysts

TI analysts are critical thinkers and researchers who analyze actors and TTPs (tools, techniques, procedures). Their work supports detection, defense, and strategic planning, often mapping to frameworks like MITRE ATT&CK and the Cyber Kill Chain.

## Types of Intelligence

- **SIGINT** – Signals Intelligence, includes COMINT (communication) and ELINT (electronic).
- **OSINT** – Open-source information from public platforms and databases.
- **HUMINT** – Human Intelligence gathered through interviews or espionage.
- **GEOINT** – Geospatial Intelligence from satellite or aerial imaging.

## Types of Threat Intelligence

### Strategic
- High-level, non-technical reports for leadership
- Focused on geopolitical risk and industry-specific trends

### Operational
- Research into threat actor TTPs
- Supports red teaming, detection engineering, and incident response

### Tactical
- Technical indicators like hashes, domains, or emails
- Used for detection and automated defenses

## Why Threat Intelligence is Useful

- **Cyber Threat Context** – Helps assess relevant adversaries and exposures
- **Incident Prioritization** – Guides decisions when triaging multiple alerts
- **Investigation Enrichment** – Adds critical background to observed behaviors
- **Information Sharing** – Builds collective defense through intelligence communities and threat feeds

## The Future of Threat Intelligence

### CVEs and CVSS
- **CVE** – Unique identifier for vulnerabilities (e.g., CVE-2019-0708)
- **CVSS** – Scoring system (e.g., CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H)

### Predictive Prioritization
Tenable’s **VPR** (Vulnerability Priority Rating) combines CVEs with real-time threat intelligence to dynamically prioritize vulnerabilities most likely to be exploited. This lets teams focus remediation on real-world threats instead of theoretical risk.
