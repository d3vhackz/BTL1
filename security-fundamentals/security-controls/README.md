# Security Controls

Security controls are safeguards or countermeasures put in place to reduce risk, protect assets, and ensure the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of systems and data.

## Types of Security Controls

### Preventive Controls
- Stop incidents before they happen
- Examples: firewalls, access controls, encryption, antivirus software

### Detective Controls
- Identify and alert when incidents occur
- Examples: SIEM alerts, IDS/NIDS, audit logs, surveillance systems

### Corrective Controls
- Mitigate damage and restore systems after an incident
- Examples: data backups, system restore points, patch management

### Deterrent Controls
- Discourage potential attackers from attempting malicious actions
- Examples: security awareness training, visible cameras, warning banners

### Compensating Controls
- Alternative measures that fulfill the intent of a missing or inadequate control
- Examples: increased monitoring to offset lack of multi-factor authentication

## Vulnerability Scanning

- **External Scanning**: Simulates attacker perspective; tests public-facing assets
- **Internal Scanning**: Provides a detailed view of internal network and systems
- **Credentialed Scans**: Authenticated view, including patch level and config data
- **Non-Credentialed Scans**: Unauthenticated, shows what an external attacker could see

## Compliance Scanning

- Validates whether endpoints and systems comply with required security standards
- Often used to enforce internal policies, industry regulations, or audit frameworks

> Security controls are only effective when chosen, implemented, and monitored in alignment with your organization's risk tolerance and operational environment.
