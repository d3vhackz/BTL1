### Chain of Custody Requirements
- **Hash verification** at each stage (MD5, SHA1, SHA256)
- **Write-blocker usage** for evidence preservation
- **Documentation standards** for all actions taken
- **Evidence tracking** from collection to court presentation

### Order of Volatility (RFC 3227)
1. **Registers & Cache** (most volatile)
2. **Memory (RAM)** - Running processes, network connections
3. **Network State** - ARP cache, routing tables
4. **Running Processes** - Current execution state
5. **Disk Storage** - Files on HDD/SSD
6. **Remote Logging** - Centralized log servers
7. **Physical Configuration** - Offline media (least volatile)
