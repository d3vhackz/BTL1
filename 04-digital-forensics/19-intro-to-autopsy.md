### Analysis Methodology Framework

#### Systematic Investigation Approach

**Phase 1: Case Initialization**
- Create new case with proper metadata
- Import disk images or data sources
- Configure ingest modules for automated analysis
- Establish investigation parameters and scope

**Phase 2: Automated Analysis**
- Execute selected ingest modules
- Monitor progress and module completion
- Review automated findings and artifacts
- Identify areas requiring manual investigation

**Phase 3: Manual Investigation**
- Navigate file system structure manually
- Examine flagged files and suspicious content
- Extract and analyze specific evidence items
- Correlate findings across different artifact types

**Phase 4: Evidence Documentation**
- Tag relevant files with descriptive labels
- Export evidence items with chain of custody
- Generate comprehensive investigation reports
- Prepare evidence for legal proceedings
