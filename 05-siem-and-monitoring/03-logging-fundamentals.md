## Understanding Security Events and Logging

### Defining Security Events

A **security event** is any observable occurrence within an IT environment that has potential security implications or provides evidence of user, system, or network activity. Every interaction, transaction, and system operation generates events that, when properly logged and analyzed, provide crucial visibility into organizational security posture.

#### Categories of Security Events

| Event Category | Definition | Examples | Security Value |
|----------------|------------|----------|----------------|
| **Authentication Events** | User and system authentication activities | Login attempts, password changes, privilege escalation | Account compromise detection, access control validation |
| **Network Events** | Network communication and connection activities | Firewall allows/denies, VPN connections, DNS queries | Network intrusion detection, data exfiltration monitoring |
| **System Events** | Operating system and infrastructure activities | Service starts/stops, configuration changes, file access | System integrity monitoring, unauthorized changes detection |
| **Application Events** | Business application and service activities | Database queries, web requests, API calls | Application-layer attack detection, business logic abuse |
| **Data Events** | Data access, modification, and transfer activities | File operations, database transactions, email sending | Data loss prevention, insider threat detection |

### The Security Logging Imperative

#### Business Drivers for Comprehensive Logging

**Threat Detection and Response**:
- **Advanced persistent threats** often operate below traditional security tool detection thresholds
