# Email Scanning

Email scanning is the process of analyzing email messages—including their headers, body content, and attachments—to detect and block malicious or unauthorized content before it reaches the user.

## What It Scans

- **Headers**: Checks sender domain, IP address, timestamps, SPF/DKIM/DMARC validation
- **Body Content**: Looks for phishing text, suspicious formatting, or social engineering language
- **Attachments**: Analyzes file types and checks for embedded malware, macros, or scripts
- **Links**: Examines URLs for known malicious destinations or redirects

## Detection Methods

- **Signature-Based**: Identifies known threats by matching malware fingerprints
- **Heuristic-Based**: Uses rules to detect suspicious behavior or formats
- **Blacklist Matching**: Blocks content from flagged domains, IPs, or addresses
- **Sandboxing**: Executes suspicious attachments in a safe environment to observe behavior

## Integration with Security Tools

- Can be integrated with:
  - **SIEMs** for alert correlation
  - **EDR/XDR** for follow-up investigation
  - **DLP** systems to block outbound sensitive data

## Actions Taken

- Quarantine or delete high-risk emails
- Flag suspicious emails for user review
- Notify administrators or trigger automated workflows
