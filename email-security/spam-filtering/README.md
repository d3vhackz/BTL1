# Spam Filtering

Spam filtering is a security control that scans incoming emails to detect and block unsolicited, malicious, or irrelevant messagesâ€”commonly known as spam.

## Purpose

- Reduce inbox clutter
- Prevent phishing and malware delivery
- Improve productivity and email system performance

## How Spam Filters Work

- **Pattern Matching**: Looks for known spam formats or structures
- **Blacklists**: Blocks emails from known spam-sending domains or IPs
- **Heuristic Rules**: Uses scoring based on suspicious traits (e.g., lots of links, strange formatting)
- **Machine Learning**: Analyzes behavior and message trends to improve detection over time
- **URL Analysis**: Checks links against malicious URL databases

## Outcomes

- Spam is automatically quarantined, deleted, or flagged
- Users may receive daily spam reports depending on system configuration
- Some systems allow users to whitelist/blacklist specific senders

## Best Practices

- Keep spam filter definitions up to date
- Enable aggressive filtering for high-risk users (e.g., executives)
- Train users to report spam that makes it through the filter

> A properly tuned spam filter not only protects users from junk but also acts as a first line of defense against phishing, credential theft, and malware.
