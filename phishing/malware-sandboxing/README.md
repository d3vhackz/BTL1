# Malware Sandboxing

Sandboxing is the process of executing potentially malicious files in an isolated environment to observe their behavior. This technique allows security teams to detect indicators of compromise (IOCs), understand malware behavior, and improve detection capabilities.

## Why Sandboxing Matters

When malware is detonated in a sandbox, analysts can monitor:
- File and process creation
- Registry changes
- Network traffic (e.g., communication with C2 servers)
- Attempts to escalate privileges or download additional payloads

This behavioral data is critical for threat detection, rule creation, and incident response.

## Tool: Hybrid Analysis

**Hybrid Analysis** is a free online sandboxing platform that allows users to upload files and view detailed execution reports in a safe, cloud-hosted environment.

### Step-by-Step

1. Go to [https://www.hybrid-analysis.com](https://www.hybrid-analysis.com)
2. Drag and drop a file or click "Browse" to upload a suspicious attachment
3. Select the desired operating system (e.g., Windows)
4. Click **"Generate Public Report"**

Once submitted, the system detonates the file and generates a full behavioral analysis report.

## What the Report Includes

- **Process activity**  
  What processes the malware spawned and how it interacted with the system

- **Network connections**  
  Domains, IPs, and ports contacted (often C2 infrastructure)

- **File system changes**  
  Any files created, modified, or deleted

- **Indicators of Compromise (IOCs)**  
  Hashes, dropped files, registry keys, and behaviors flagged by multiple engines

## Use Case

If you're investigating a phishing email with an unknown attachment:
- Extract the file
- Upload it to Hybrid Analysis
- Review the report to determine malicious intent
- Document behavioral indicators for your investigation

## Conclusion

While enterprise-grade sandboxing platforms offer deeper integration and control, Hybrid Analysis provides a powerful and accessible alternative for analysts and researchers. It's ideal for verifying suspicious files and enriching reports with behavioral insights.

> Behavioral analysis is often more revealing than static signature scans. Sandboxing turns malware into intelligence.
